# Fission Chips
## 2D Infinite Runner game made in Unity
### This was a Game Development Committee group project. Our group settled on a fish/beach theme, where the player controls a fish. The goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging obstacles and collecting water to prevent drying out.

- Added collision detection using Unity's 2D physics to handle player-obstacle interactions 
- Added player and obstacle animations to maximize user experience
- Efficiently generate and destroy game objects as they are spawned into one side and destroyed on the other side.
